1. create sperate module/file for seperate routes
      eg: '/api/courses' ==> create module called 'courses' inside 'routes' folder

2. cut and paste all related routes in to that folder

3. + using router object instead of app object
   + replacing the 'app' keyword with the 'router'
   + export router object

4. loading seperated routes into index.js(main file)
      inside 'index.js' =>  const courses = require('./routes/courses')
                            app.use('/api/courses', courses);

5. remove routes path of separated routes modules
      eg: before => routes.get('/api/courses/:id')
          now    => routes.get('/:id)
